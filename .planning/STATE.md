# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-19)

**Core value:** AI agents handle real inbound communications autonomously — answering questions, booking viewings, managing maintenance, chasing arrears — so the human team focuses on high-value work.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 5 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-19 — Roadmap created, requirements mapped, phases defined

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Build property knowledge base before AI agents — agents need property context to answer intelligently
- [Roadmap]: Voice (Phase 3) after text-channel agents (Phase 2) — voice compounds every failure mode; text agents must be battle-tested first
- [Roadmap]: Arrears chasing deferred to Phase 5 — compliance requirements (harassment law, vulnerability protocols) need proven audit infrastructure from earlier phases
- [Research]: Use Vapi for voice (Squads maps to receptionist-to-specialist routing); switch from Retell has zero cost (existing voiceAgentService.ts is fully mocked)
- [Research]: Use OpenAI Agents SDK for text channels; pgvector on existing Supabase for knowledge base — no new infrastructure needed

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 3]: Vapi UK telephony configuration (Twilio SIP/webhook forwarding for UK number) needs hands-on testing — exact configuration unverified. Validate during Phase 3 planning.
- [Phase 5]: Arrears chasing compliance rules (UK Pre-Action Protocol, FCA vulnerability guidance) need professional legal review before Phase 5 planning. Research flags this as a gap.
