We provide a free instant online valuation to give you an immediate estimate. For a formal, no-obligation offer, we’ll conduct an in-depth phone valuation and deliver a written offer within 24 hours. No waiting, no delays – just a straightforward start to your sale.

2. How fast can you complete the purchase?
We can finalise the sale in as little as 7 days, but we work entirely to your timeline. Whether you need to sell urgently or require more flexibility, we adapt to your priorities.

3. How are you able to buy so quickly?
Our speed comes from exclusive advantages:

Dedicated legal panel: Specialist solicitors with expertise in fast cash purchases.

5. Are there any fees or hidden costs?
Absolutely none. The offer you receive is the amount you’ll get – no commission, no legal fees, no surprises. We cover all costs, including your solicitor’s fees.

6. Do you buy houses in any condition or location?
Yes! We buy any home, anywhere in the British Isles – from Scotland to the South Coast. Age, condition, or location won’t stop us.

7. What if I change my mind about selling?
No pressure, no obligation. Walk away at any time, and we’ll happily restart the process later if needed.

Guaranteed sale: We’re the buyer, not just a middleman.

We cover all legal fees and provide expert solicitors. You’re welcome to use your own, but we’ll still pay their costs.
